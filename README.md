# Python-ChatBot-Guessing-Game

This is a simple game where the ChatBot asks you to guess a fruit!

The ChatBot selects a fruit for a list which is saved in the file “fruits.txt”

It then allows you three chances to guess the fruit.

If you do not guess the fruit on time, then you lose, of course! But after the ChatBot tells you the fruit it was thinking of, it then goes on to ask if you want to know more about the fruit.

If you say yes, then the ChatBot will access Wikipedia for information on the fruit and read it out to you…

Have fun!
